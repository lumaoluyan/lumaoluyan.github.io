title: Adidas Neo Chinese New Year 2018 Campaign
---
## The Brief

Adidas is one of the leading sportswear brands in China. It wanted to revamp its Adidas Neo brand to differentiate it from Adidas Originals and Adidas Sport.

## The Problem

Adidas described it’s Neo sub-brand as “youth-oriented sports fashion”. Knowing this, we needed to explore innovative and emerging media channels. Engaging consumers in a new and refreshing way.

## Strategy & Executions

Our focus was on highlighting the concept of “endless possibilities” in fashion styles.

We launched Adidas Neo’s first-ever brand campaign on Douyin. China’s new creative short video platform Douyin (also known as TikTok). The campaign was a creative fashion video challenge.

This was followed by creative videos created by Adidas Neo celebrities and brand video filters. Users could customize their own dynamic endless fashion show with filters/wallpaper/stickers to engage in the challenge.

## My Role

My role included designing the graphic patterns for the filters used on Douyin (TikTok). I also art directed the celebrity videos, helping to create the storyboard and directing the video during the editing phase.

We took the visual style from the video filters and applied them to other platforms, including the e-commerce store. This emphasized the campaign visual identity.

## Results

* 150m total video views
* 2.8m engaged

It outperformed all other brand platforms on Douyin. Including Michael Kors, Pepsi, Pizza Hut and Samsung.
