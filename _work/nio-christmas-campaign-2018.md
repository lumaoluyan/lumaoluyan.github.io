title: NIO Christmas Campaign 2018
---
## The Brief

NIO is an Chinese electric car company. They wanted to celebrate sustainability with their customers during Christmas, based on the idea “light up your Christmas”.

## Problem

How could we show people how to create a sustainable environment for Christmas. And create a of discussion that people can participate in and engage with.

## Execution

Inspired by “light up your Chrtistmas” and sustainability message that NIO wanted to portray, we came up with the idea of “ A light tree for a living tree.” People could replace their real and plastic trees with a light tree.

To make a tree of light we created a Christmas tree lightbox projection. One that could be generated online and shared on social media. And an offline physical version. 

This offline version was available to Members of NIO. They could get the materials and instructions sent to them for free — allowing them to create a light box for their Christmas tree that they created online.

All this ran alongside events NIO organised with Roots and Shoots. A non-profit institution that focuses on environmental problems.

## My Role

I designed the lightbox, tree pattern used in the projection and UI for the web app.

I also art directed the 3D animation for the web app (H5 app) intro, worked with the Spanish 3D animation studio Serial Cut. And art directed the photography for social media posts.

## Learning

## Working with another team

It was a great opportunity to work with the 3D design studio Serial Cut. Being the first for me to work across time zones, I learned how to respect the working rituals and ethics of that team.

## Working under pressure

How to stay calm during the pressure of a campaign launch. My director kept me calm and helped me choose what to really focus on, which was the quality. 

## Working on a software project

Working with programmers isn’t to just sit with them and check the layout design. I’d help with keeping the project in scope, ensuring if things are not missed or overdone so we can deliver the work on time. I also learnt how to  check the flow and structure of the web app works from a UX point of view.
