In 2018 OPPO, a Chinese mobile manufacturer, were in the process of updating their new visual identity. The work was being done with Pentagram. However, they also needed a video to tell the story of their new logo and brand.

At early phase, we also have designed a series visual adaptation for new identity so they can use at print and digital. To demonstrate the creativity and its design philosophy within the OPPO.

OPPO focus on the beauty on the technology,this film tells the story via an art installation featuring giant, real-life OPPO logos. 

I helped with the storyboard and the styling, however, I couldnâ€™t continue following up the project in the team.

Still I was really happy about the client accept our director recommendation for the production. I am always a big fan of Lernert & Sander since I was in uni. Further info to see full video.
